# Absolute-Link
This is a link shortener project designed to shorten your link , Technologies used in the project are : React Javascript Mongoose express

and other technologies

I absolutely admit that I used chatgpt and other sources to complete this project due to time restraints.

The server runs on production config and starts on port 5001.

I have implemented all the hooks and middleware seperately to avoid confusion.

This repository will constantly be updated on the resources used to make this and how to deploy this offline and also with some screenshots
